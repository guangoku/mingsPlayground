## Decision: Vercel

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Recommended for deployment

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the project requirements and hosting options, **Vercel** has been selected as the hosting platform for this personal portfolio website. This decision is based on performance requirements for global access (US + China), technical compatibility, and cost-effectiveness.

## Project Requirements

- **Type:** Static React website with client-side routing
- **Technology:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Build Size:** ~325KB JavaScript, ~73KB CSS (gzipped)

- **Preview Deployments:** Unlimited for testing changes
- **Dashboard:** Clean, intuitive interface
- **CLI Tools:** Excellent command-line experience

## Performance Expectations

### Vercel Performance Metrics

- **US Load Time:** ~800ms
- **China Load Time:** ~1.2s
